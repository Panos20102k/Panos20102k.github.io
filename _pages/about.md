# About Me

I am a PhD student in Systems Engineering at Cornell University.  
My research focuses on optimal control, adaptive control, and learning-based control methods with applications to robotic systems (e.g., LIMO robots).

Previously, I received my [degree] from [University Name], where I worked on [brief description].
